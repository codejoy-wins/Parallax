        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>Due to your positive feedback.  I have decided to put more effort into designing this site.  I hope you enjoy my analysis of your teams.  If I talk shit about your team, it is only just to mix it up as showering praise on every team would be boring, so please don't take it personally.  You need a little salt for your steak.</p>

        <h2>Nearly undefeated with CMC coming back</h2>
        <p>ESPN has decided Taysom Hill at TE is unfair.  He is only eligable for qb from now on.  However, he was already in Andrew's TE slot, so they're leaving him there.  This is similar to the strategy I threatened to employ with having a healthy Jordan Reed in my IR spot to prevent Seif from replacing Kittle.  ESPN allows you to do these things, but punishes your by restricting your lineup moves.  However, if you have your lineup already set you can get away with it.  Andrew is certainly in a position to get away with a QB at TE this week against who else but lucky me.  I wonder how our commisioner would feel if Andrew used this "strategy" against him.</p>

        <h2>I'm giving this team the nod because they have the most points</h2>
        <p>I don't love the running backs or the tight end, but this team is stacked at wide receiver and has Patrick Mahomes.</p>

        <h2>Another team with a losing record, I just like the potential</h2>
        <p>It doesn't seem like Trevor knows which quarterback to start, but tight end and rb1 are never in doubt.  Dobbins playing well kind of hurts my soul.  It's just been an awful year for me in terms of trading Aaron Rodgers, AJ Brown, and JK Dobbins away and watching them succeed. If the Ravens were smart, they'd lean on Dobbins to revitalize their offense.  I think they will do just that when he's off the covid list.  Still, I don't care how good Allen Robinson is when Foles can only throw for 100 yards total.</p>

        <h2>Kyler Murray, Davante Adams, and Derrick Henry</h2>
        <p>This team has Davante Adams which is enough.  Kyler Murray runs in a TD basically every game and that kills in fantasy.  Henry is a better real back than a fantasy back but the points will come in bunches come playoff time.  I had to include this team in the top 4.</p>

        <h2>Hi Guys, this is mostly just trying out the parallax effect</h2>
        <p>More content will be coming soon.  I wanted to design the power rankings differently and it was easier just to start from scratch.  I appreciate all of your feedback.  Tell me what you want on this site.  Thank you.  Oh, and about Joe Burrow... my season is over.  My entire strategy revolved around the addition by subtraction Andy Dalton- Joe Burrow effect.  I thought all the Bengals were underpriced and would break out without Dalton holding them back.  It's just a disaster now. I was all in on the Bengals and I really can't imagine winning after Beckham and Burrow's ACL tears.  See you next year!</p>
