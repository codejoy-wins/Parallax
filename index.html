        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>Due to your positive feedback.  I have decided to put more effort into designing this site.  I hope you enjoy my analysis of your teams.  If I talk shit about your team, it is only just to mix it up as showering praise on every team would be boring, so please don't take it personally.  You need a little salt for your steak.</p>

        <h2>Tom Brady, Joe Burrow</h2>
        <p>Do you know which quarterbacks lead the league in passing attempts?  Tom Brady and Joe Burrow. Fantasy points come from opportunity, and when Tampa Bay gets near the goal line, they trust Tom Brady to throw it in.  Meanwhile, Joe Burrow carries the Bengals offense and has the trust of his coaching staff in his rookie year already.</p>
